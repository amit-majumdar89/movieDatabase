            "content": "The Suicide Squad...\r\n...stayed true to the hype of the anti-hero teams in DC.\r\n\r\nI feel like it wasn't really a sequel but rather a reboot and ignoring the first film.\r\nThe action was insane and BLOODY brilliant, with a stellar cast. And they LITERALLY killed off the first team at the very start of the film! To be honest, I wasn't really surprised as I didn't see more of them in later scenes of the trailer. But I was surprised they killed off Captain Boomerang - he was basically the primary member of the team! And I especially wanted to see more character build up with Savant, learn more of his backstory. Instead, he just turned out to be a totally wuss that's only good at killing small birds! But what shocked me the most was Rick Flagg's death!\r\n\r\nStill, Idris Elba and John Cena were fucking awesome as Bloodsport and Peacemaker, respectively. And King Shark was hilariously awesome. Funnier that Groot because at least he says more than three words - although, \"hand\" would have to be my favourite moment!\r\n\r\nI did had mixed feelings from the start, but then I started to really get into it all!",

I was surprised when pretty much the whole first team was killed off straight of the bat especially since some of the characters where played by well known actors, it wasn't all about Harlequin, John Cena and Idris Elba worked well together, good movie worth going to the cinema to watch it.",

Film Viewed By Me At **_NOVO CINEMAS_** Sharjah UAE, On August 16\r\n______________________________________________________ \r\n\r\nSo usually, I try and maintain a somewhat orderly structure with my Reviews, namely : 'Intro->-Body->-Summation'. This time, just to 'Keep-it fresh', I just thought I'd shake things up a bit, and { quite literally } write my review, er . . . .¬† 'backwards'. Hence, without further ado, here goes üòâ‚ùó \r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS : \r\nAs a 'doting' parent, I'm going to come clean and tell you that I had a real problem with the fact that I -{ Did }- really enjoy this -Certifiably- { Decadent } \"Bloodsoaked Adult Goof-fest\", and in no small measure either, at that. Sure it was 'dominated' mostly by -Cartoonish- violence meant only for 'Mature' viewers, ( it has an M.p.a.a certified rating of 'R' ) ; however ...the, um, how shall I say... \"Sheerly, Obscenely, Gratuitous\" levels of gore in said movie -Did- somewhat take me by surprise . . . given as it comes -directly- from the Director -best- know for his ( -relatively- ) \"More kosher\" -M.c.u- ( 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' ) . . . blockbuster fare. \r\n\r\nHIGH POINTS : \r\n1. \"Peacemaker\" : The cheeky,¬† sneaky', yet unequivocally -{ \"Bold, Fresh & Fabulous\" }- takedown of the long, long, long standing -Imperialist- tendencies ; but more significantly, the -{ \"Hypocricies & Triple-standards\" }- of, \"Past United States Governments\", -Symbolically- , of course.\r\n2. Simply Put : basically -\"Everything\"- the { Stunningly üí£ üí•‚ùó } Talented Margot Robbie, ( 'Harley Quinn' ) does ; with an 'Extra-special' mention for her -protracted- \"Escape From Coronel\" fight scene. 3. Daniela Melchoir, ( 'Ratcatcher-two' ) : This peculiarly endowed 'Anti-heroine' has a seiously -Bizarre- talent... but she, along with Idris Elba's 'Bloodsport', the just bespoke Margot's 'Harley' ( -and Others- ) ...end up bringing a veritable -{ \" Ton Of -Unexpected & Genuine- Heart \" }- to 'The Suicide Squad'. \r\n\r\n**\" A Conflicted, yet -Thoroughly- Entertained, 8.50 Marks Out Of 10 From Me \" ;** if only out of 'Absolute Admiration' for the 'Funny, & Insanely-Creative' James Gunn. It bears iterating that I ( -Very Obviously- ) won't be letting my kids anywhere \"Near\" this super-Crazy, Super-Fun picture . . . -{ However }- . . . the Reviewer in me has -Indeed- won over the Parent, in this instance, all the same ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è üòÇ .",

Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX. \r\n\r\nWith the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. \r\n\r\nEach squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster. \r\n\r\nGunn just can't seem to miss.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
